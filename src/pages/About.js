        <p>
          I'm a recent Software Engineering graduate from California State University San Marcos with
          interests in the intersection between software engineering and evolving industries such as aerospace, defense,
          and finance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I aspire to be a generalist in the fields of SWE and CS, understanding the inner workings of the highest level
          of software abstractions down to the lowly assembler, and everything in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also strive to be an active contributor to the ever-evolving open source community. Here are a few projects
          I created or contributed to recently:
